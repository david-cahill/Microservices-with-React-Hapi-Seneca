# Microservices-with-React-Hapi-Seneca
This repo demonstrates how you would setup a React application that communicates with multiple node js microservices.

# What is this?
There are currently two microservices in this application: users and products.
When you run npm start, the app sends off a "request for data" from each microservice by referencing their name and the relevant command.
Each microservice then replies with some test data.

# Start it up

- npm install
- npm start
- Check server-side console to see each microservice's response

# To do

- Add a simple React application.
- Make API requests to each microservice from the React app.
- Render some data in the UI based on the response from the API.
- Add some Hapi routes.

# Any questions/suggestions?
